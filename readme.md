#Processing Experiments

Those are my experiments with processing that I started during my university and that now that I'm trying to get back to processing and arduino, I chose to make it public and to improve them.

Some of them are already finished while some of them are being rewritten because when I wrote them for the first time I was a 0 in programming.

All them are working with Processing 2.0 by the time
